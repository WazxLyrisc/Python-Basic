# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This codebase currently contains a single file: `day1.py`. It appears to be a Python script, and there are no other modules, configuration files, or documentation present. The project structure is minimal and does not follow a multi-file or package architecture.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- All code is located in `day1.py`. There are no submodules, classes, or external dependencies detected.
- No build, test, or CI/CD workflows are present. There are no requirements or environment files.
- No project-specific naming conventions or patterns are established yet.
- No integration points with external services or APIs are present.

## Developer Workflows
- To run the script, use:
  ```powershell
  python day1.py
  ```
- No test framework or test files are present. If tests are added, document the workflow here.
- No debugging configuration is present. Use standard Python debugging tools if needed.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- If expanding the project, follow standard Python script conventions unless new patterns are introduced.
- Document any new dependencies, workflows, or architectural decisions in this file as the project grows.
- Reference `day1.py` for all current logic and patterns.

## Example Expansion
If you add new files or modules, update this document to describe:
- The purpose of each major file/module
- Any new workflows (e.g., tests, builds)
- Project-specific conventions or integration points

*This file should be updated as the codebase evolves to guide future AI agents and developers.*
